# Just a simple lean canvas

this project is built with express.js (backend) and vue.js (frontend). backend and frontend are separated. the frontend is in the `client` folder.

first, install dependencies in both projects.

then, create and fill `.env`.

to start developing you can use:
```bash
npm run dev
# if you are using yarn
yarn dev
```

for login, you need to create a user in the MongoDB database. unfortunately, there is no seeder for it yet! :(

Have fun.
